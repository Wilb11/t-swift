# t-swift

Project to analyze all of Taylor Swift's major albums according to spotify stats about each song, to investigate how her songs have changed overtime and understand if there are any patterns in the data.

The end result will be an interactive website where users can explore the evolution of her music.

Maybe to add later - sentiment analysis on each song, to identify if Spotify's data points correlate with the sentiment at all.
